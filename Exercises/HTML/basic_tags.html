basic tags

<head>
  Everything that needs to be loaded before the page can render, 
  like CSS and JavaScript, goes inside of this tag, along with 
  the favicon and any other meta information.

<title>
  This will be the name that appears in the tab bar for your webpage.

<body>
  The actual visual part of your webpage, everything 
  that the user could see or interact with, will go in this section.

<div>
  These are useful, generic containers for other HTML elements. 
  If you have multiple elements that you want to modify in some way, 
  lets say indent, you can nest them all inside of a <div> element 
  and then give it a CSS class.

<h1>
  These are your header tags. If you were writing a newspaper, you would put your headline within this tag. 
  There are multiple levels as well so you can have subheadings. 
  <h1> through <h6> are all valid header tags, each becoming increasingly smaller.

<p>
  The paragraph elements almost always just contain some text. 
  They're pretty straight forward and don't get too complicated.

<span>
  The span elements are usually used to apply some CSS class 
  to a single letter or small phrase within a paragraph.

<img>
  This tag is used for embedding images into a page, and it is 
  one of the few exceptions to the rule "all tags must be closed". 
  The image tag doesn't need to be closed. Here is what it normally 
  looks like: <img src="http://i.imgur.com/ME4Kf.gif" />

<a>
  The anchor tag is used for creating hyper links to other webpages.  
  Here is an example: <a href="http://github.com/samolds">Click here!</a>

Tag Attributes

HTML tags can also have attributes. For example, the <img> tag will 
need a src attribute to specify where the image file is located and the <a> tag 
will need an href attribute for the link to the page.
